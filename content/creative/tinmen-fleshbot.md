abstract: |
  Goes toward a factory -> smile mission -> no news was heard from the factory ->
  new experimental flesh robots have taken control of the bio-implents of the
  factory workers -> Agent M82 needs to discover what happened, and deal with it ->
  when he reports the news to the higher up -> happy smile mascot tells him to
  wipe everything, workers included because the accindent would hurt their brand
  too much if it was heard.
  the workers did awful stuff to the robot for Smile, and as those look human they are traumitised.
  one of the workers ended up breaking down, and wanted to save the robots, leading to them getting power.
  maybe his brain got absorbed by the leader, or he is taken prisoner and tortured as an exemple for revange.
  show in-company infighting ?
  Agent M82 -> Agent Mattew 
moodboard: |
  - dark and grim like Blade runner -> realistic / live action 
  - slime `band tm` are colorfull, happy.
  - ex: lullaby is bright yellow, soft looking -> when it shoots anime flowers
    hide the explosion exiting the barrel but a loud bang is heard

A puff of dark yellow smoke slowly left a pair of cracked and shivering lips.
For the second time this morning, Agent M82 looked with a scowl at his branded
`JoyPuffs©` and wondered why he had even bought the damn thing. He was freezing,
and a few puffs of a cheap cig would have soothed him wonderfully, but of course
an agent of SMILE couldn't be caught with something as brand-unfriendly as that.
The detective snuggled tighter in his wool coat -- no fancy `Warmth and
Comfort©` suits for the likes of him. He cursed one last time his broken
snowmobile, before continuing his walk toward the factory. He made a crunch with
each step of his heavy boots, just loud enough to be heard above the howling of
the wind.

Agent M82 arrived a few minutes later in front of the factory's heavy metal
doors. He put his `JoyPuffs©` away in his left breast pocket, and quickly
surveyed his surroundings. The snow was fresh and bore no footprints, not
unusual by itself given the recent blizzard. A pile of snow was stacked in front
of the gargantuan doors, looking entirely out of place in front of a supposedly
active factory. A gale stronger than the ones before swept over him, leading him
to briefly pat his coat to look for cigs before catching himself and cursing.

Before trying to contact the workers inside, he stepped back from the door.
Following his training, he walked a few hundred meters on both sides of the
entrance, trying to find any other clues on the situation inside.

The giant mass of metal plates and bolts was coal black, in sharp contrast with
the snowy landscape it was lost in. It stood at least a few hundred meters high,
and was spread as far as the horizon. On top of the black mountain of a building
sprawled a forest of chimneys, spewing columns of dark fumes that rose high in
the sky. The detective looked at them, and smirked in self derision at how much
he was envying their warmth.

Despite looking for them, he couldn't locate any windows or secondary exits,
giving the factory the air of a sealed tomb. There were no other signs of
civilization around it, and the closest human settlement he had seen was several
hours away by snowmobile. He reckoned a `Fulfillment rehabilitation center©`
wouldn't have looked out of place here.

Agent M82 clutched on his wounded leg, hoping he wouldn't bleed out to death too
soon. He heard the abomination crawling toward him with its remaining arm.
Gripping his `Lullaby©` gun tighter than before, he rose on his uninjured leg
with a wince. The detective lined the thing's head with his crosshair, his
vision spinning from blood loss. The monster was only a few meters away. He
could hear its claws ripping into the steel floor with each lunge forward. The
grinding noises were so loud, they seemed mere inches away from his ears. After
a deep breath, he finally got its skull in the sight line, and pulled the
trigger. The bullet blasted it with a splash, painting the corridor with red goo
and metal shards.
