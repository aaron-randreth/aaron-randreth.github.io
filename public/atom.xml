        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A puff of dark yellow smoke slowly left a pair of cracked and shivering lips.
For the second time this morning, Agent M82 looked with a scowl at his branded
&lt;code&gt;JoyPuffs©&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and wondered why he had even bought the damn thing. He was freezing,
and a few puffs of a cheap cig would have soothed him wonderfully, but of course
an agent of Smile couldn&#x27;t be caught with something as brand-unfriendly as that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detective snuggled tighter in his wool coat -- no fancy &lt;code&gt;Warmth and Confort©&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; suits for the likes of him -- and continued marching on toward the
factory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made a crunch with each step of his heavy boots, just loud enough to
be heard above the howling of the wind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>
