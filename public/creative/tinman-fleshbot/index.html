<p>A puff of dark yellow smoke slowly left a pair of cracked and shivering lips.
For the second time this morning, Agent M82 looked with a scowl at his branded
<code>JoyPuffs©</code> and wondered why he had even bought the damn thing. He was freezing,
and a few puffs of a cheap cig would have soothed him wonderfully, but of course
an agent of Smile couldn't be caught with something as brand-unfriendly as that.</p>
<p>The detective snuggled tighter in his wool coat -- no fancy <code>Warmth and Confort©</code> suits for the likes of him -- and continued marching on toward the
factory.</p>
<p>He made a crunch with each step of his heavy boots, just loud enough to
be heard above the howling of the wind.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<hr />
<p>Agent M82 arrived a few minutes later in front of the factory's heavy metal doors.
He put his <code>JoyPuffs©</code> away in his left breast pocket, and quickly surveyed his
surrounding. The snow fresh and bore no footprints and even looked fresh, not
unusual by itself given the recent blizzard. A pile of snow was stacked in front
of the gargantuan doors, only slightly higher than it should be given the
supposed industrial traffic.</p>
<p>A gale stronger than the ones before swept over him, leading him to briefly pat
his coat to look for cigs before catching himself and cursing. Unhurried about trying to
contact the workers inside, he did his due diligence and made a quick tour
around the facility. The giant mass of metal plates and bolts was coal black, in
sharp contrast with the snowy landscape it was lost in. It stood at least a few
hundred meters high, and was spread as far as the horizon. On top of the
black mountain of a building sprawled a forest of chimneys, spewing columns of
dark fumes that rose high in the sky. The detective looked at them, and smirked
in self derision at how much he was envying their warmth. Despite looking
around, he couldn't locate any windows or secondary exits, giving the factory
the air of a sealed tomb. He reckoned a <code>Fullfilment rehability center©</code>
wouldn't have looked out of place here.</p>
<p>While walking back toward the entrance, he briefly wondered if the facility had
any snow mobiles he would be able to borrow so as to avoid making the trek back.
It had been a few hours since he had last seen any other human settlement, he
wasn't excited about braving potential blizards again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Agent M82 carefully considered the poltry crewman before him. He seemed
especially jolly, and had an assured vigor to his stride that contended with his
crackling voice. Mattew noticed him shifting uncomfortably in his bright orange
uniform, and readjusting his safety helmet. There was a surprising lack of
familiarity to his gestures.</p>
<p>"So, are you sure there is no problem to report here", inquired the inspector.</p>
<p>"N-n-no chief, nothing to report. I don't know why the big shots at HQ bothered to send you in little frozen home"</p>
<hr />
<p>Agent M82 clutched on his wounded leg, hoping he wounldn't bleed out to death too
soon. He heard the abomination crawling toward him with its remaining arm.
Gripping his <code>Lullaby©</code> gun tighter than before, he rose on his uninjured leg with a
wince. The detective lined the thing's head with his visor, his vision spinning
from blood loss. The monster was still a few meters away, but he could hear its
claws ripping into the steel floor with each lunge forward. The grinding noises
as loud as if it was inches away from his ears. After a deep breath, he finally
got its skull in the sight line, and shot at it. The bullet blasted it with a
splash, painting the corridor with red goo and metal shards.</p>
